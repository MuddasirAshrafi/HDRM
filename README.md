Project Overview
The "High Dimensional Retail Modelling" project leverages geospatial analysis to understand visitation patterns to retail stores. By integrating road network data, store locations, and customer visitation data, the project aims to provide actionable insights for business owners to optimize store operations and improve customer experiences.
Key Objectives
Analyze visitation patterns to retail stores using geospatial data and Placekey mappings.
Identify road closures and calculate alternative routes to minimize customer travel disruptions.
Provide business owners with tools to understand and optimize customer interactions, store accessibility, and retail performance.
Features
Preprocessing Road Networks: Fetch, clean, and save road network data using OpenStreetMap.
Road Closure Analysis: Map real-time road closures to geospatial nodes and assess their impact on customer routes.
Route Optimization: Calculate original and alternative routes for customers affected by road closures.
Store Accessibility Insights: Map store locations to census tract centroids and provide metrics for customer reachability.
Interactive Visualization: Generate detailed maps using Folium to visualize road closures, routes, and store visitation patterns.
NOTE: "The project is still under development"
